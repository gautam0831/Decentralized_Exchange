# Decentralized_Exchange

This project aims to build a DEX (Decentralized Exchange) on the EVM. Many design decisions were taken which are outlined in the text file. 

Solidity files token.sol and exchange.sol provide functionality for the token exchange (creating pool of liquidity, adding/removing liquidity, swapping token with ETH and ETH for token). 

exchange.js Javascript file provides JS rendering of the DEX for all aforementioned functionalities. 

Other files were not included. Completed as part of class course.
